    <h1>Privacy Policy — Simple Weather</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 25, 2025</p>

    <section>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Simple Weather does <em>not</em> collect, store, or share any personal information. This short policy explains the app permissions and confirms that no user data is transmitted to the developer or third parties.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>This application does <strong>not</strong> collect or store personal information. No personal data is uploaded to any server. The app does not use analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>
      <div class="note">Important: when the app uses a permission (see below), that permission is used only for the described purpose and data is not collected or retained.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Permissions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Location (Approximate or Precise)</strong>: Used only to provide location-based weather information. Location data is processed on the device and is <strong>not</strong> transmitted or stored by the developer.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet</strong>: Used solely to fetch weather data from the weather provider. No user-identifying data is sent to the developer's servers because the developer does not operate any servers for this app.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you deny location permission, the app will use manual city search or a default location to provide weather information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The app uses OpenWeather API to fetch weather data. When you request weather information, the API receives technical data such as your location coordinates (if you grant location permission) or city name (if you search manually) and your IP address as part of the standard API request. This data is processed by OpenWeather according to their privacy policy. The developer does not collect, store, or have access to any personal data from users.</p>
      <p>The app does not integrate any analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting SDKs that collect user data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>This app is suitable for users of all ages, including children. The app does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children. No registration, account creation, or personal data submission is required to use this app.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>Because the app does not collect or store personal data, there is no user data retained by the developer to delete. To remove any app-stored preferences from your device, uninstall the app or clear the app data in your device settings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>As no personal data is collected or stored by the developer, there is no data to access, correct, or request deletion of from the developer. You may still control permissions on your device (for example, revoke location access) at any time via system settings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p class="contact">If you have questions about this privacy policy, contact us at: <a href="mailto:klyra.dev@gmail.com">klyra.dev@gmail.com</a></p>
